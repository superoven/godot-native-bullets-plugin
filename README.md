</p>

This is a **GDNative plugin**, compatible with Godot 3.4.x and up.<br>
Not compatible with Godot 4.x.

Pre-built binaries are provided for:

- Windows x86-64 (v1.2)
- Linux x86-64 (v1.1)
- macOS Universal (x86-64 + arm64, v1.2)

## Features

1. Spawn and move high amounts of bullets.
2. Configure multiple types of bullets, each with its own behaviour.
3. Set custom properties to categories of bullets or to any single bullet.
4. Customize bullets using shaders.
5. Configure bullets with a collision shape, layer and mask of your choice.
6. Toggle collision detection on or off for each type of bullet.
7. Set the pool size and z index for every bullet type.
8. Choose the target viewport or canvas layer.
9. Extend the plugin using C++.

## Step by step

### Installation

1. Copy the addons/native_bullets folder in your addons folder.
2. Navigate to Project -> Project Settings -> Plugin and enable the Native Bullets plugin.

For best performance, toggle `use_bvh` off in Project Settings -> Physics -> 2d.

### BulletKit creation

The first thing to do is create a BulletKit resource and choose how bullets will appear and behave tweaking its properties.

1. Create a new empty resource and assign one of the scripts you can find in the `addons/native_bullets/kits` folder to it.
   In this example, we'll assign the `basic_bullet_kit.gdns` script.
   New properties will appear in the resource inspector.
2. To get started fill the `texture` property with any texture you have.
3. As the `material`, you can use a new material resource using the `animated_shader.gdshader` you can find in the utils folder.
   This shader takes care of animating your bullets if you specify more than 1 frame in its parameters.

4. For now, turn off `collisions_enabled`, turn `use_viewport_as_active_rect` on, turn `rotate` off and set `unique_modulate_component` to `None`.
   See the [Reference](#reference) section to learn more.

</p>

This BulletKit resource is now ready to be used!

### BulletsEnvironment node

In order to spawn bullets in the scene, a BulletsEnvironment node is needed.
This is the node that will define which kinds of bullets will be available during its lifetime.
Only one BulletsEnvironment node can be active at the same time and if you add another one to the scene tree its configuration will replace the previous one.

The BulletsEnvironment node has to be configured to choose which kinds of bullets will be able to spawn, their maximum amount and their z indices.

1. Create a new BulletsEnvironment node.
2. Choose how many types of bullets this node will be able to spawn. Increase `bullet_types_amount` to 1 for now.

3. A new section of the inspector will appear below. Unfold the `Bullet Type 0` entry.
   Here, drag & drop the BulletKit resource you created earlier to let the node know that you'll want to spawn the bullet described in it!
4. Choose the maximum amount of bullets setting the `pool_size` property and the their `z_index`.
   3000 and 1 will be ok.
   Leave the `parent_hint` property empty, it will make the bullets spawn in the nearest Viewport or CanvasLayer up in the scene tree.

</p>

Nice! Now the bullets are ready.

### Spawn bullets

The last step is to spawn a lot of those bullets.<br>
You can use the utilities provided by the plugin to spawn bullets in a variety of ways, but let's do it manually for now.<br>
Create a script.

```gdscript
# Assign a valid BulletKit via the inspector.
export(Resource) var bullet_kit


func _process(delta):
	if Input.is_key_pressed(KEY_SPACE):
		shoot()
	if Input.is_key_pressed(KEY_RIGHT):
		rotation += PI * delta
	if Input.is_key_pressed(KEY_LEFT):
		rotation -= PI * delta


func shoot():
	var bullet_velocity = Vector2(cos(global_rotation), sin(global_rotation)) * 30.0

	# Define which properties will be set to the newly spawned bullet.
	# The bullet will be spawned in the same position as this node,
	# travelling in the direction defined by its rotation.
	var properties = {
		"transform": Transform2D(global_rotation, global_position),
		"velocity": bullet_velocity
	}
	# Spawn a bullet using the selected BulletKit and setting the properties defined above.
	# Bullets is an autoload.
	Bullets.spawn_bullet(bullet_kit, properties)
```

Here you go!
Now attach this script to one of your 2D nodes, start the game, press space to shoot and right/left to change the bullets direction!

## More examples

The repository contains an `examples` folder containing a few pre-configured scenes, ready to be played in the editor.<br>

</p>

Below are reported some of the most common things you can do.

### Bullets spawning

Spawn bullets.

```gdscript
export(float) var bullets_speed = 50.0


func shoot():
	var bullet_kit = preload("res://path/to/following_bullet_kit.tres")

	# The bullet will be spawned in the same position as this node,
	# travelling in the direction defined by its rotation.
	var bullet_velocity = Vector2(cos(global_rotation), sin(global_rotation)) * bullets_speed
	# Follow the first node inside the Player group.
	var target_node = get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("Player")[0]

	# Define which properties will be set to the newly spawned bullet.
	var properties = {
		"target_node": target_node,
		"transform": Transform2D(global_rotation, global_position),
		"velocity": bullet_velocity
	}
	# Spawn a bullet using the selected BulletKit and setting the properties defined above.
	Bullets.spawn_bullet(bullet_kit, properties)
```

### Bullets handling

You can manipulate and set properties of bullets even after you spawned them.

```gdscript
export(float) var bullets_speed = 50.0


func shoot():
	var bullet_kit = preload("res://path/to/basic_bullet_kit.tres")

	# Use `obtain_bullet` to receive an opaque BulletID object.
	var bullet_id = Bullets.obtain_bullet(bullet_kit)

	# You can then use `bullet_id' to set and get properties.
	Bullets.set_bullet_property(bullet_id, "transform", Transform2D(global_rotation, global_position))
	Bullets.set_bullet_property(bullet_id, "velocity", Vector2(cos(global_rotation), sin(global_rotation)) * bullets_speed)
```

### Collision detection

When a bullet collides with a body or an area, the best way to get the data of the colliding bullet is to connect to the `area_shape_entered` signal.

```gdscript
func _on_area_shape_entered(area_id, _area, area_shape, _local_shape):
	if not Bullets.is_bullet_existing(area_id, area_shape):
		# The colliding area is not a bullet, returning.
		return

	# Get a BulletID from the area_shape passed in by the engine.
	var bullet_id = Bullets.get_bullet_from_shape(area_id, area_shape)

	# Get bullet properties, transform, velocity, lifetime etc.
	var bullet_transform = Bullets.get_bullet_property(bullet_id, "transform")
	# If you previously set a custom Dictionary containing the `damage` key as the data property, you can retrieve it.
	var bullet_damage = Bullet.get_bullet_property(bullet_id, "data").damage

	# You can also retrieve the BulletKit that generated the bullet and get/set its properties.
	var kit_collision_shape = Bullets.get_kit_from_bullet(bullet_id).collision_shape

	# Remove the bullet, call_deferred is necessary because the Physics2DServer is in its flushing state during callbacks.
	Bullets.call_deferred("release_bullet", bullet_id)
```

## Reference

The plugin has a few main components, explained below:

### @ BulletKit

This is the resource used to configure each type of bullet.<br>
Every BulletKit spawns its own bullet instances that support different kinds of properties.<br>

The plugin comes with 4 base variants that can be customized via the editor:

<details>
<summary>BasicBulletKit</summary>
<br>
This is the most basic BulletKit, makes bullets move, generally at constant speed.<br>
It's configurable with:

- `texture`: controls what texture is sent to the bullet material.
- `material`: the material used to render each bullet.
- `collisions_enabled`: enables or disables collision detection, turning it off increases performances.
- `collision_layer`: the collision layer to use during collision detection. Visible only if `collisions_enabled` is on.
- `collision_mask`: the collision mask to use during collision detection. Visible only if `collisions_enabled` is on.
- `collision_shape`: the CollisionShape to use during collision detection. Visible only if `collisions_enabled` is on.
- `use_viewport_as_active_rect`: if enabled, uses the current viewport to detect whether a bullet should be deleted.
- `active_rect`: the rect outside of which the bullets get deleted. Visible only if `use_viewport_as_active_rect` if off.
- `rotate`: controls whether the bullets automatically rotate based on their direction of travel.
- `unique_modulate_component`: controls which modulate component in the material will be used as a unique value for each bullet instance. This can be used to offset bullets animation frames by unique amounts inside shaders and it's needed due to Godot not supporting material instance properties in 3.x.

### @ BulletsEnvironment

The BulletsEnvironment node is responsible for defining which bullets will be spawned in the current scene.
It can be configured through the editor setting which kinds of bullets will be used, the pool sizes and the z indices.

The `parent_hint` property indicates which node to use as a starting point to search for the first available Viewport or CanvasLayer up in the scene tree.
The resulting node will then be used to render the bullets.

Note: any change to a BulletsEnvironment node at runtime needs the node to be reloaded to take effect.

#### Signals

```gdscript
# Emitted when the BulletsEnvironment is about to commit itself to configure which kind of bullets will be available.
# Can be used to customize the node configuration before applying it.
signal tree_entering(node : BulletsEnvironment)

## Compiling and extending the plugin

The plugin can be extended with new BulletKits that are more suitable to your specific use cases.<br>
To do so, you have to download the entire repository together with submodules, write some C++ code and recompile the plugin.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/samdze/godot-native-bullets-plugin
```

New BulletKits can be added creating a new header file inside the src/kits directory.
Here's an example.

```c++
// src/kits/custom_following_bullet_kit.h

#ifndef CUSTOM_FOLLOWING_BULLET_KIT_H
#define CUSTOM_FOLLOWING_BULLET_KIT_H

#include <Texture.hpp>
#include <PackedScene.hpp>

Next, register you Godot classes inside the `gdlibrary.cpp` file.

```c++
// src/gdlibrary.cpp

#include "bullets.h"
...
...

#include "kits/custom_following_bullet_kit.h"

...
...

extern "C" void GDN_EXPORT godot_nativescript_init(void *handle) {
	...
	...

	// Custom Bullet Kits.
	godot::register_class<CustomFollowingBullet>();
	godot::register_class<CustomFollowingBulletKit>();
}
```

Compile the bindings and the plugin for your selected platform.

```
cd addons/native_bullets/godot-cpp
scons platform=windows target=release generate_bindings=yes -j4

cd ..
scons platform=windows target=release
```

Finally, create a NativeScript resource setting `bullets.gdnlib` as its library and `CustomFollowingBulletKit` as its class name.<br>
Now you can attach this script to your BulletKit resources and use it.
